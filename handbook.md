Title caps on titles.

No spaces on slashed words, for example, use either/or instead of either / or. 

When referring to a neutral or unknown person, use "they" or "the individual" rather than he/she or s/he. Use 'oneself' in place of 'himself or herself'.

Use the Oxford comma. 

When using quotes, ending punctuation only goes inside the quotes if it is an important part of the phrase being quoted. For example you would say
He said, "I won't go in there alone."
or
He said he would "raise a ruckus", but I don't think he really will. 

Bulleted lists should not have commas at the end nor be phrased as one long sentence over all the bullet points. For example, use:
- red
- green
- blue

and not:
- red, 
- green, 
- and blue.
